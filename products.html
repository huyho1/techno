                        The Portable Attachable Wheelchair Enhancer (PAWE) is an innovative device that transforms any standard manual wheelchair into an electric one. PAWE solves the major issues faced by current electric wheelchairs, which are typically expensive, difficult to transport, and limited in their capabilities for individuals with specific disabilities. 
                        With PAWE, users can enjoy the benefits of an electric wheelchair at a fraction of the cost ($200 vs. $2,000+), and the lightweight design makes it easy to bring with them wherever they go. PAWE also offers a modular control system that can be adapted to meet the unique needs of individuals with different disabilities, such as breath control and eye control. 
                        PAWE is marketed to a broad range of customers, including institutions (such as airports, hospitals, museums, and malls), elderly individuals, temporarily disabled individuals due to injury, and those who cannot afford a regular electric wheelchair or prefer a detachable attachment. With an estimated 100,000 units sold per year and a $50 markup, PAWE is poised to 
                        revolutionize the electric wheelchair industry.
