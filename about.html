                    <p>
                        <br>
                         Technotonin is a company that solves problems by bringing together a team
                         of inventors to come up with solutions. The inventors work on prototypes for
                         three months, and if necessary, more time is given to certain projects. Once a
                         final prototype is made, Technotonin patents the invention and either licenses
                         or sells it to another company. Technotonin also helps the partner company
                         bring the product to market. In essence, Technotonin acts as a catalyst for innovation, 
                         identifying problems, fostering creativity, and bringing solutions to market.
